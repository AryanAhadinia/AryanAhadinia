## Hi 👋

This is Aryan. I'm a computer sciecne student with a focus on Machine Learning.

### Starting Point

I've started programming at age 15 at Allameh Helli Tehran High School. A [graphical Hanoi towers solver](https://github.com/AryanAhadinia/hanoi/) was my first programming artifact at 2016-2017 that was not an ultimate learning toy. 😅
