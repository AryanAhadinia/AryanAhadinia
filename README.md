## Hi ðŸ‘‹

This is Aryan. I'm a computer sciecne student with a focus on Machine Learning.

### Contact

I allways love to hear from old friends and connect with new people. Just drop me an email!

### Starting Point

I've started programming at age 15 at Allameh Helli Tehran High School. A [graphical Hanoi towers solver](https://github.com/AryanAhadinia/hanoi) was my first non-toy programming artifact at 2016-2017. I came across that code years after and decided to record it on my GitHub.
