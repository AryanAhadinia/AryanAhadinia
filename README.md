## Hi 👋

This is Aryan. I'm a computer sciecne student with a focus on Machine Learning.

### What I'm doing Now?

I'm currently master of computer science student at EPFL. As a part of my studies, I'm now doing a six month internship at Oracle Labs Switzerland.

### Open Source Contributions

Notablely, I have contributed to the following open source projects.

- [oracle/wayflow](https://github.com/oracle/wayflow) (during my internship at Oracle)
- [persian-calendar/persian-calendar](https://github.com/persian-calendar/persian-calendar)

### Background

#### Education

I have previosuly obtained my BSc in computer engineering at Sharif University of Technology.

#### Research

During my BSc, I have worked on graph mining in the context of social networks. We were mainly interested in applying probablistic methods on time-series data. We published two articles then, namely, [DiffStru](https://github.com/maryram/DiffStru/) and [DANI](https://github.com/AryanAhadinia/DANI/).

#### Teaching

During my BSc, I had the chance to engage in teaching as a TA and Head TA. When I was Head-TA of _CE-282: Linear Algebra_, I have created a [persian LaTeX template for assignments](https://github.com/AryanAhadinia/persian-assignment-template) then, which is now used across several courses there. Feel free to change or adopt it for your usage.

### Starting Point

I've started programming at age 15 at Allameh Helli Tehran High School. A [graphical Hanoi towers solver](https://github.com/AryanAhadinia/hanoi/) was my first programming artifact at 2016-2017 that was not an ultimate learning toy. 😅

### Contact

I allways love to hear from old friends and connect with new people. Just drop me an email. You can find my email on my [homepage](https://aryanahadinia.github.io/).
